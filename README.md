# A repository for Althouse and Meade web maps

## Local clone repository saved on T Drive here: T:\github\web-maps

The following steps will guide you through the process of adding a new web map (same process applies for updating an existing web map in this repository except start at Step 2):

  1.  Rename qgis2web folder appropriately for the project e.g. bheRenewablesWindFarmBatAnalysis
  2.  Upload the renamed folder to this repository [here](https://github.com/am-gis/web-maps/upload/main), or add it to the local clone repository saved on the T Drive here: T:\github\web-maps
      - If uploading straight to the GitHub repository, steps 3 and 4 will be completed automatically and you can skip to Step 5.
  3.  Once added/updated, the gh-pages branch will need to have changes committed. The following steps are performed on GitHub Desktop, which can be downloaded here: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  4.  Commit changes to main with some description of activity e.g. "Added **webMapNameGoesHere**" or "Updated index.html for **webMapNameGoesHere**"
  5.  Once completed, push origin (Ctrl+P)
       - If skipping from step 2, **_pull_** origin (also Ctrl+P).
  6.  Switch to gh-pages branch and update from main Ctrl+Shift+U)
  7.  Again, once completed, push origin (Ctrl+P again)
  8.  Close GitHub Desktop

It may take a moment to for changes to be reflected, but once the above steps have been completed, view web map at: am-gis.github.io/web-maps/**webMapNameGoesHere**
